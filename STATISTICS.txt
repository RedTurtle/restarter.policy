Statistics
==========

Set up an instance to run the statistics update processor. This can
be an existing instance, or a separate one::

    $ bin/instance statistics

This process should always be running, but may be stopped and started
at any time without data loss.

Keeping a separate database for updates
---------------------------------------

Using the ``plone.recipe.zope2instance`` recipe for buildout, this is
how you would configure a mount point for a Plone site located at
``/site``::

          zope-conf-additional =
              <zodb_db statistics>
                 mount-point /site/portal_stats
                 container-class restarter.policy.tool.StatsTool
                 <zeoclient>
                   server ${zeo:zeo-address}
                   storage statistics
                 </zeoclient>
              </zodb_db>

This should match a ``plone.recipe.zeoserver`` part::

          zeo-conf-additional =
              <filestorage statistics>
                path ${buildout:directory}/var/filestorage/statistics.fs
              </filestorage>

Note that you must add the mount point using the ZMI before installing
the add-on for it to work.
